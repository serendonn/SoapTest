The plugin provides tasks for running SoapUI tests and mocks during a Gradle build.

## Build Status

## Usage

This plugin has a fairly complex dependency tree. To use this plugin successfully we need to override some dependencies through forcing versions or completely substituting modules.
See approach [SmartBear uses solve jar-hell problem in their maven plugin.](http://smartbearsoftware.com/repository/maven2/com/smartbear/soapui/soapui-maven-plugin/5.3.1-RC/soapui-maven-plugin-5.3.1-RC.pom)
As a result your build file can look like this:

```groovy
buildscript {
    ext {
        soapUIVersion = '5.3.1-RC'
    }
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/' }
        maven { url 'http://www.soapui.org/repository/maven2/' }
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        compile("com.smartbear.soapui:soapui:$soapUIVersion") {
            exclude group: 'com.jgoodies', module: 'forms'
            exclude group: 'com.jgoodies', module: 'looks'
            exclude group: 'com.jgoodies', module: 'binding'
        }
    }
    configurations.all {
        resolutionStrategy {
            force 'com.jgoodies:binding:2.0.1',
                  'com.jgoodies:forms:1.0.7',
                  'com.jgoodies:looks:2.2.0'
        }
    }
}

apply plugin: 'io.byteshifter.soapui'
```

But for most common and trivial use-cases, buildscript configuration could be much simpler:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        maven { url 'https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/' }
        maven { url 'http://smartbearsoftware.com/repository/maven2/' }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath('gradle.plugin.io.byteshifter:soapui-gradle-plugin:5.3.1-RC')
    }
}

apply plugin: io.byteshifter.plugins.soapui.SoapUIPlugin
```

## Tasks

The `soapui` plugin pre-defines the following tasks out-of-the-box:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Task Name</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>soaptest</td>
        <td>TestTask</td>
        <td>Runs the SoapUI tests as specified by the plugin properties. Internally invokes the SoapUITestCaseRunner class as described there.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>soapload</td>
        <td>LoadTestTask</td>
        <td>Runs the SoapUI loadtests as specified by the plugin properties. Internally invokes the SoapUILoadTestRunner class as described there.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>soaptool</td>
        <td>ToolTask</td>
        <td>Runs the specified and configured code-generation tool. Internally invokes the SoapUIToolRunner class as described there.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>soapmock</td>
        <td>MockServiceTask</td>
        <td>Runs the specified and configured code-generation tool. Internally invokes the SoapUIMockServiceRunner class as described there.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Full Example

```groovy
soapui {
    test {
        projectFile = 'sample-soapui-project.xml'
        testSuite = 'OleTest'
        printReport = true
        junitReport = true
    }
    load {
        projectFile = 'sample-soapui-load-project.xml'
        printReport = true
    }
    tool {
        projectFile = 'sample-soapui-tool-project.xml'
        iface = 'IOrderService'
        tool = 'wsi,axis1,axis2'
    }
}
```


## Complex Example

There may be times when you have multiple test suites inside the same SoapUI project. You wouldn't want to maintain several Gradle projects, so the plugin uses convention mapping. This means you can have many tasks, but override the properties at runtime. Here's an example:

```groovy
soapui {
    test {
        projectFile = 'sample-soapui-project.xml'
        printReport = true
        junitReport = true
    }
}

import io.byteshifter.plugins.soapui.tasks.TestTask

task testSuiteA(type: TestTask) {
    testSuite = 'SuiteA'
}

task testSuiteB(type: TestTask) {
    testSuite = 'SuiteB'
}
```

What you should notice in the example above is that we still use the `soapui` convention block with the nested `test` section. You may also have noticed that we have defined 2 new tasks of type `TestTask`. The `TestTask` is what runs the `SoapUITestCaseRunner`. The only difference between the 2 tasks is that they set their own value for `testSuite`. Through the magic of convention mapping the rest of the values are inherited.


## Tons of TestSuites for enterprise-grade SoapUI test projects

In case of many TestSuites you might want use such approach to reduce a lot of duplications in your build script code:

```groovy
[
    'SuiteA',
    'SuiteB',
    // ...
    'SuiteZ',

].each { suite ->
    tasks.create(name: suite, type: io.byteshifter.plugins.soapui.tasks.TestTask) {
        testSuite = suite
    }
}
```

Please, note: to run all of the TestSuites in this case, you can use only `gradle soaptest` command.


## SoapUI test runner and plugin versions mapping

Previously, versions between soapui-gradle-plugin and SoapUI test runner was't synchronized.
But after version 5.0.1 we will try to keep them synchronized as soon as newer SoapUI will be released.

| soapui-gradle-plugin | SoapUI test runner |
| -------------------- | ------------------ |
| 0.2                  | 5.0.1              |
| 5.1.0                | 5.1.0              |
| ...                  | ...                |
| 5.3.0                | 5.3.0              |
| 5.3.1-RC             | 5.3.1-RC           |
